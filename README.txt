Hello Professor! Hope you like my theme for the website!

EXTRAS: I did my own take on the website by giving it a space theme! I thought copying exactly what the website looked like already was boring.

EXTRAS: Flexible for many monitors. Changing the size of the monitor will not effect any elements on the website. (At least not that I have discovered)

EXTRAS: Mobile friendly as well!

PLUGINS: Datatables, Fancybox, Tilted Page Scroll, JQuery UI
